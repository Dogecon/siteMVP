## Carpe Lunam Events Association is pleased to pull back the curtain to reveal our plans for Dogecon 2018, an absurdist celebration of cryptoeconomics and meme culture in Vancouver, BC.

### Dogecon will be a playful and participatory decentralist community celebration during Summer Solstice, with core events occurring from the evening of Thursday June 21 to the late hours of Sunday June 24.

#### Swaths of time in between will exist as a well-documented but relatively permissionless culture crawl showcase of the thriving tech, arts, and culture scene of Vancouver, with lots of chances to enjoy the summer scenery. Overall, the four day weekend will build upon the “unconference” event format to craft a participatory “unconvention,” with special attention paid to elements of gamification, performativity, and whimsical creativity.

Check out the site links above for more information on this whimsical convention!
