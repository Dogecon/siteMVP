### Artists are welcome to submit meme/absurdist/crypto-themed work to senddogememes@gmail.com. In your email, please limit your attachments to 2 jpegs or pngs and include a short description of your artwork as well as the size and weight.

<h2 id='online'> We are online! </h2>

### It takes a village to celebrate 2018: Year of the Doge. We want this event to belong to as many of us as possible -- spreading the burden of sponsorship helps us diversify its design and ensure we’re including everyshibe along the way!

### Please [email us](mailto:carpelunam@gmail.com) for more information on how to get involved as a speaker, sponsor, artist, musician, or volunteer.

### And we are also [on Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#dogecon:matrix.org), come say hi!

### Subscribe to [our Youtube channel](/youtube). We often livestream from behind the curtains, so keep an eye out for those.

### We are also on Twitter. Help us doge it up with [@DogeconVan](https://twitter.com/DogeconVan)!
