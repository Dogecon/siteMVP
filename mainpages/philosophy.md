### [Our Mission](#mission)
### [Transparency and Financial Inclusivity](#finance)  

<h2 id='mission'> Our Mission </h2>

Dogecon 2018 started as a beautiful meme dream around the end of this past January, with a group of Vancouver decentralists imagining a complex and innovative celebration of this Year of the Doge. Everytime we hit a crossroads between doing this the normal way, and “forking” in a more radically playful direction, we tried to stay true to the latter path.

From inception, Dogecon’s organizers have prioritized financial inclusivity and accessibility. The spirit of Dogecoin has always been about sharing the wealth, and we’ve seen the cryptocurrency sector swell over the past year into a formidable global market that is impossible for even legacy finance institutions to ignore. We reach out to enlist your help in ensuring that crypto culture is shaped by communities, for communities; your potential sponsorship helps us keep public ticket costs low, and makes it easier to get all our honoured guests to Vancouver for this magical weekend experience.


<h2 id='finance'> Transparency and Financial Inclusivity </h2>

We’ve been “eating our own dog food” on the financial equity principle as an organizing team, as well. Carpe Lunam Events Association was formed as a nonprofit member-funded society to serve as the seat of Dogecon’s operations, and we eschew the mentality that too often equates crypto conferences with revenue machines. Some of our first dedicated budget allotments were to secure legal counsel and accounting advice, to ensure our books and practices are solid and transparent.

Aside from outside specialists, all team members from founders to artists make the same contracting wage ($25/hour), allowing us to pay more people, more equally. We’ll offer opportunities for people to volunteer 10+ hours in exchange for a free weekend pass, as well as set up accommodations for out of town volunteers to stay cheap or free. If our revenue goes above and beyond our projections, rather than pocketing the difference, we’ll apply those additional funds to further scholarship allotments for guests’ travel and increased honorariums for speakers and artists.

Finally, we plan to maintain as much transparency as possible around these allotments, and all sponsors will have access to our internal financial modeling upon request. When we finalize the event’s financial statements in early June, we will upload the documents (with names/sensitive information redacted) to IPFS and hash the file in the Dogecoin blockchain, to ensure that from start to finish, we’ve stayed true to our our whimsical love for the shibe.
