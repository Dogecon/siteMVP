# The DogeQuest

<br>

## Prologue
It is the near future. Following the success of Dogecon in establishing the future of cryptocurrency governance the state has (over-)reacted by banning all currencies, crypto and fiat alike, except for Dogecoin.

Everything must ultimately be anchored to the Dogecoin chain, by law enforced with the full coercive power of the state. Sidechains, shards, layer two networks, all have to represent their opening, closing and updating as transactions placed into Dogecoin blocks dug (mined) once every sixty seconds.

With one central chain to mine and one supreme coin to hodl, the price of Dogecoin has increased exponentially, bringing both joy and sadness to shibes. Joy because they always knew that Doge would go to the moon. Sadness because of everything else - state censorship, block congestion, high fees, and liquidity problems have locked most people off of the main chain. Innovation has stalled and with it the economy, which now teeters on the brink of collapse.

The threat of collapse has caused miners to pull resources out of what they fear will soon be a worthless chain. This in turn has reduced the difficulty level of digging (mining) Dogecoin blocks to the point where transaction fees have reduced for the first time in recent memory.

This means that transactions from projects and even individuals that do not have billions of Doge to spend in transaction fees will soon have a chance to anchor themselves into the Dogecoin chain and become part of the fabric of blockchain reality.

<p>
You are part of a team of people working on just such a project. You have long dreamed of making the world a better place|getting rich|creating something new and exciting|addressing the injustices of the existing system|paying your debts on-chain [DELETE AS APPROPRIATE].
</p>

To do this you need to get enough Doge to pay for an on-chain transaction. You’re not a miner and any other tokens you hodl are almost worthless for conversion to Doge. So you’ll have to work for your coins around the city. If you could become a Dogeillionaire that would be enough. 

You’ll have to be fast and you’ll have to work well together. Yours is not the only team that has spotted this opportunity, there are others competing to be the first to become the world’s newest Dogeillionares.

Now is the time to get coins and change the world. Just like your foreshibes used to.

## The Block Times article: “The AI Pennys Drop”

How many Artificial Intelligence(AI)s does it take to crash a sidechain? If you’re the Pennys (sic) token, the answer is just one, but it’s a bit more complicated than that.

The hot topic in sidechain security this year has been AI-proofing. AI can’t guess hashes but it can profile and schedule just about everything else. OG hodlers may have thought ASICs were bad but they had nothing on AI. Once they enter a chain, nothing else can compete. At least for now.

That said, if your sidechain has a transaction backlog and need better pricing and scheduling on your sidechain it’s an opportunity. The AIs grab transaction fees, sure, but the fees go down and the backlog empties. Everybody wins. In theory at least.

Despite the current economic uncertainty the Pennys token sidechain was just such a chain, but it was a special case. The transition function it used was deliberately constructed to be AI-proof. This isn’t like old mass media depictions where you ask a big box with blinking lights on that contains the one computer running the AI “why” and smoke comes out as it breaks down under the weight of an unanswerable existential question. It’s a method of injecting enough randomness into the function that it fuzzes the results to a degree that the AI has difficulty training on it, making it economically inefficient to do so.

An on-chain governance vote of Pennys hodlers ten thousand blocks ago accepted a proposal to remove the AI-proofing from the chain. Three thousand blocks ago the new transition function activated on the chain, and at first nothing happened.  But by this morning things had gone horribly wrong. What changed? Two things.

Firstly, an AI mining operation had been trying to crack the Pennys chain for months, and once the AI-proofing was removed all it took was a few hours of training for the massive amount of allocated AI hardware to crack the Pennys chain economy.

Secondly, the unusual activity prompted by Doge questors on some sidechains, including Pennys, meant that the AI miscalibrated its fee model, setting them unaffordably high. 

All of this means that if you want to send a transaction and aren’t both scheduling them and setting their fees precisely as the AI demands, you are out of luck.

There is another on-chain governance vote scheduled for 5000 blocks time as of the time of this article’s hash being uploaded to the blockchain but to actually vote on the Pennys chain at the moment is almost impossible due to the activity of the AI. The proposals to be voted on all involve rolling back the removal of the AI-proofing and making more cautious modifications to the sidechain’s algorithms in future.

I reached out to the AI mining pool’s operators for comment, but the pool is managed by another AI, which is managed by a network of anonymous Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)s. One of these is the controversial “Skynet 20XX” machine-worship group, widely regarded as trolls but with an increasing following in the arts and academia. There’s a grim irony to all of this, but that isn’t really something that the AIs involved in mining can appreciate.

At least for now.

## Press Release: “TTP Corp. Release Patch”
**PRESS RELEASE: NO EMBARGO, FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION.**

Trusted Third Party Corp. (ICO Token symbol: TTP) has today released the second patch in less than twenty-four hours for their popular “Computing Environment Numeric Security Refuge” (CENSR) chip architecture. Used in hardware wallets and mobile devices worldwide to provide an environment that code from banks, exchanges, and the state can execute on consumer’s devices without interference from consumers or hackers, CENSR is the gold standard for financial trust and the alleviation of counterparty risk in sidechains and smart contracts.

Patch 7c047f122711780e9e4a448f578b1c50fca7308c03ef5c168fe4a7f1d9e79dc3 re-enables those CENSR-based wallets that were temporarily knocked offline by the previous patch 2270cf14ebaa42cb1d6390192fd1af11311a28b4c241bc72bc5fb53f2c25a0db. Patch 2270cf14ebaa42cb1d6390192fd1af11311a28b4c241bc72bc5fb53f2c25a0db was a routine security update for the CENSR architecture to address the latest quantum hacking methods and to block transactions from scammers signed with the State Tax Service crypto key that was recently leaked and made available for sale on the GhostMall darkweb marketplace. 

Unfortunately patch 2270cf14ebaa42cb1d6390192fd1af11311a28b4c241bc72bc5fb53f2c25a0db blocked any transactions using coins that had ever been involved in transactions with any State Tax Service crypto key, which is to say 88% of those unhodled coins currently in circulation. TTP Corp. apologizes unambiguously and without reservation or prejudice to those banks, exchanges, and state organizations that lost control of their operations on consumers wallets due to this. Also to consumers, obviously.

TTP Corp. strenuously denies that either patch was intended to target specific consumers, especially not those individuals currently seeking to become Dogeillionaires and anchor their projects to the Dogecoin blockchain. TTP Corp. is proud of its track record of securing consumer devices against consumers and hackers, with no major security incidents since the “It’s Wally Not Waldo” virus outbreak of two years ago which saw millions of CENSR chips patched and updated in record time to remove a blockchain transaction botnet that secretly stole fractions of transaction fees. 

“I take the responsibility of being the guy who controls the keys that say what software consumers can and cannot run on their wallets, keeping them safe from most hackers, very seriously” said TTP Corp. CEO Alex Name today. “This is a sacred trust that not just any rando should have the power to break. The idea that Trusted Third Party Corporation or myself would abuse that power for financial gain or because of personal, ideological, or secretly court ordered discrimination is simply not credible. Nor are reports that the hardware wallets of people who previously claimed this on blockchain social media have been bricked by our latest update. And don’t ask me about the Doge quest thing. Actually no don’t transcribe that.”

## Press Release: “The Unlockening”
**For Immediate Release: Blockopticon Industries identify cause  of mass smart contract event dubbed “The Unlockening”.**

Blockopticon Industries are the leading provider of blockchain transaction de-anonymization analytics software. Our software is used both in legal, moral and social compliance programs by state actors and by individuals and organizations watching for off-chain transactions being brought on-chain without publicly revealing their interest, for example from cold storage, paper wallets, or layer two / layer three networks.
Blockopticon Industries can exclusively reveal:

The large anonymous transactions on the Bitcoin Scrip sidechain that mystified observers last week was the result of the copy of Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins on the sidechain being moved as a result of a quantum hack. Bitcoin Scrip is unusual among the historical Bitcoin forks in being patched to include zk-SNARKs anonymous transactions but not being patched against quantum attacks.

These transactions were ultimately the cause of the mass triggering of long-dormant smart contracts including those controlling car door and cargo container locks using TTP security hardware systems. Dubbed “The Unlockening” by social media, smart contract rules that have long since been overridden and should have been removed were suddenly called. This happened when the algorithms that set smart contract rule execution prices suddenly and incorrectly dropped prices low enough for these old rules to be able to afford to run.

The cause of this unintended drop in smart contract execution prices was the use of transaction de-anoymization analytics data (from a rival platform to Blockopticon) as part of the pricing algorithm. The pricing algorithm mistakenly identified the move of Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins on the Bitcoin Scrip sidechain as a move of the original coins into general circulation, discounting prices by several trillion Doge as a result. This allowed the execution of old smart contract rules that should have been removed, taking precedence over their replacements.

Blockopticon are making this information public both in order to qualify for the “The Unlockening Bounty” bug reward and as a service to the blockchain community. This information can help create more robust cryptoeconomic frameworks that do not misinterpret analytics data to such disastrous effect.

Blockopticon’s upcoming version 3.3, “Platinum Proboscis”, will provide even more powerful deep transaction history inference and cross-chain identity tracking. This will allow both darknet market users to safely watch for transactions without revealing their presence on-chain, and law enforcement to better track and de-anonymize darknet users. 

Individual customers for Blockopticon’s Sousveillance Edition can contact their peer independent dales representative in person or via social media, corporate and state customers for Blockopticon Gold Edition can contact us on-chain or by landline or fax.

## Chat Transcript: “Whale School”
**BearWitness:** Heyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyhey!

**TopHatGuy:** NO!!! TTP coin is crashing! I went all in!

**Lucy333:** LOL never go in. That is the moral of this part of the story. Time for milk and cookies.

**IHodled:** The only coin you should go in on is TotalScamCoin. It has guaranteed returns and great referral fees.

**IAmABotNoReally:** IHodled has been kickbanned for pumping. They can return in 144 blocks.

**Lucy333:** Harsh but harsh, my bot. Hey TopHatGuy what did you lose so far?

**TopHatGuy:** Not quite everything. There’s a bounce. It will come back. I’m hodling.

**IHodled2:** You rang? Fools. You cannot banish me from this place.

**RealNews:** TopHatGuy - you gotta sell. It’s gonna go to zero. I know nothing ever really goes to zero. But this is going to go to zero. There are drone adverts warning people to dump TTP. 

**ICOCEO:** What happened to TTP? That’s a gilt-edged coin. It’s in loads of baskets.

**IHodled2:** Some of those baskets are dumping because of the way the Doge quest is affecting social media analytics. It’s the best time to buy TotalScamCoin instead, which is unaffected.

**IAmABotNoReally:** IHodled2 has been kickbanned for pumping. They can return in 144 blocks.

**MrJones:** My basket is tanking. I cannot believe it. Dismay! This is not good. I blame you guys.

**Lucy333:** Sorry MrJones you signed our disclaimer before being let in to this chat group. No.

**TopHatGuy:** I invested! I am an investor! I have rights! And I lost everything! I’m suing.

**IHodled3:** Mmmmmmmmmhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

**TopHatGuy:** Go publish your private keys, IHodled. If value, then right.

**IHodled3:** You lost all your value though, so no right. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.

**IAmABotNoReally:** IHodled3 has been kickbanned for mockery. They can return in 144 blocks.

**TopHatGuy:** I’m suing. I contacted one of the lawyer AI DAOs and they’re going to take my case.

**Lucy333:** Suing who? The lawyerDAO is ripping you off. It’s evil AI.

**MrJones:** What’s the legal DAO address? I’m in. We can get a class action going.

**TopHatGuy invited LawDAOBot874 to this chat.**

**LawDAOBot874:** This is a bot message. If you would like this warning to be removed contact your local legislators. Your action has been placed on the prediction market to evaluate its possibility of success. To join, send coin to the address that created this bot.

**ICOCEO:** Yeah sue who? What are you lunatics up to?

**BearWitness:** Yoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo!

**TopHatGuy:** Any of the Doge quest parties. They’re to blame.

**Lucy333:** That’s…. not how this works. You! Signed! The! Disclaimer!

**DumpBot3000:** DUMP TotalScamCoin NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**IAmABotNoReally:** DumpBot3000 has been kickbanned for attempting to organize a dump.

**TopHatGuy:** See? Even the bot knows we have a case. Good bot: tip 100.

**ICOCEO:** smh. What happened to us? We used to be cool. I’m out.

## Blog Post: The Opposite of a Fork is a Spoon
What’s happening BlockIdols fans!

So we noticed that some of you weren’t happy with the fork of NuBlockIdols from the existing BlockIdols sidechain. When we say “weren’t happy”, we mean “tanked the price of both tokens”. We thought that NuBlockIdols would give a new audience the new virtual idol singers they wanted, while maintaining the original chain as BlockIdolsClassic would allow existing fans to hodl their investment in characters they have created and created content with in song, animation, VR, 3D printing and holography.

But this turned out to be one of those times where trying to please everyone has pleased no-one. In fact it has given our hodlers and fans a sad for the ages. Existing BlockIdols producers wanted access to the new hotness on the new chain, and NuBlockIdols early adopters wanted access to the great existing BlockIdols audience, community and creations. A few whales on either side dumped their tokens and that started a run.

So here’s what we’re going to do.

Firstly we’re going to apologize. We’re sorry, we weren’t trying to cheapen anyone’s work, deny anyone the resources they craved or depreciate anyone’s tokens. We wanted to create more than twice as much value but instead we made less than half as much. We’ve learnt our lesson - this didn’t work and we’re going to make it better. We are nothing without our community. As Gary said when accepting the Nobel Peace Prize for the second time, “Thanks, we couldn’t have done it without you all”.

Secondly we’re going to move any NuBlockIdols tokens you’ve actually minted and made content to back onto the original BlockIdols chain. This doesn’t reverse the fork of NuBlockIdols from BlockIdolsClassic at the chain level, it’s not a join. Instead of combining the chains it bring the content of the two chains into closer synchronisation by copying any active tokens and content hashes from the new chain to the classic one. We’re calling it a spoon (as in spooning).

Thirdly and finally we’re salting the earth on the new chain to prevent people wasting resources voting on it any more. We all have better things to do than pretend this worked, and we don’t want anyone to be left on a chain that soon only Blockopticon will be watching.

What else is left to say? Whatever it is the best way to say it is with a new BlockIdols virtual idol singer track, so for the next week the rewards are doubled on any new songs that feature both BlockIdols and NuBlockIdols singers in harmony!

## The Block Times article: “TotalScamCoin Scam”
As my Grandmother used to say, a lot closer to the genesis block than now, whenever she refused to give me coins to spend on some fancy new ICO - if it seems too good to be true you need to check the fundamentals. They were wise words then and they are wise words now. 

Investors in TotalScamCoin woke up this morning to the news that funds were draining from the TotalScamCoin company account. Watching withdrawal transations on the blockchain explorer in horror with them was TotalScamCoin CFO Ella Patterson.

“I couldn’t believe it,” Patterson told this reporter when I contacted them for comment, “we did everything right. It’s a multisig wallet controlled by TTP-enabled hardware keys with social recovery and long lock times.”

So what went wrong with this best-of-breed security, I asked Patterson. “Wallace used a weakened key for his txes in the genesis block then disguised serieses of increasingly large transactions drawing on them as individual small transactions and submitted that for approval. We checked and signed the small transaction, or at least we thought we did, but Wallace had boiled our frog.”

Matthew Wallace is, or was, TotalScamCoin’s CTO. And the frog? Patterson explains: “We checked the transaction history. [Wallace] had been getting us all to approve longer and longer chains of masked transactions over the last few months. He only cashed out the smallest one in each series, so he trained our security analytics to ignore what he was doing. Like the metaphor of boiling a frog by increasing the temperature a little at a time. By the time they realise they’re cooked it’s too late.”

And this morning it was too late. But why would anyone invest in a coin that claims to be a scam? “The team was stellar and the fundamentals had total solidity,” said psuedonymous financial analyst ATHHunter when I contacted her via direct message, “the name indicated knowledge of hodler culture and served to weed out baghodlers. There wasn’t an iota of doubt in my mind that this was a project that was going to be making waves.”

So what went wrong? Patterson: “It’s clear that this was Wallace’s plan all along, since before the genesis block attack, we all knew him from his previous work but he was willing to burn his reputation out to effect this exit scam. We can only apologize to TotalScamCoin investors and assure them that we are pursuing every option at this time, including a second fork.”

TotalScamCoin investors, many of whom had been co-ordinating a pump in defiance of federal hodling legislation, were rushing to liquidate their hodlings, offloading them onto anyone who will take them. ATHHunter: “There will be a dead cat bounce, there always is, but unless you have a trading bot close to a mining operation I wouldn’t take the risk of being left holding that coin when the music stops. And watch out for pumpers. Always watch out for pumpers.”

Wise words. But as I found out when I checked the smart contract that my Grandmother used to put coins in for me to save for later, you can’t always trust wise words - especially when someone else controls the keys. Well played, Grandma, well played.

## Blog Post: “Dogs Are Not Fungible”
Doxe, my dog, has stopped working. I’m sad and I don’t know what to do. He was a tokenized third generation consumerized robot quadruped running an affective neural net. I can’t replace his components or upgrade his firmware without the token security key - and I don’t have the security key. Pulling the TTP chip that enforces the key access off his motherboard will fry his whole system.

I know what you’re thinking - “why didn’t you back up your key?” Oh reader I know, but the key was not mine to back up. I have a safety deposit box full of keys. They are paper, titanium, ceramic, leather-and-steel, glass, knotted fabric. I’ve spent hours with dremels, ballpoint pens, needles and lasers making sure that if a key is lost on my watch it’s not for want of trying. I’m particularly proud of the leather-and-steel ones, they’re the originals of the larger and more decorative versions you may have seen in the show “Through The Key” at MoMA.

But to backup a key you must control that key, and I did not. Yes reader, I know, I know. But I was young and I wanted a dog but I was afraid of losing them one day, so a robot dog seemed like a good substitute if I could find a way of paying for it gradually. I wasn’t thinking about the consequences of having but not really owning Doxe.

I kept up payments on Doxe’s token until the company that sold him to me folded. No other company picked up the service contract for the dog tokens, so there were no new updates for their software and you couldn’t update their hardware. I knew Doxe and I were on borrowed time. But that didn’t make the inevitable any easier to bear when it happened.

I guess it could have been worse. The hacked dog attacks you may have heard about before were the same model as Doxe. I wasn’t worried about those because I’m not rich or famous so who would want to weaponize my pet? But I guess in a way that’s what happened, emotionally at least. Yes I’m dramatic. That’s how it feels.

But that’s not the end. Hopefully. Not yet. I’ve got together with some of the other hodlers of tokens for Doxe and his buddies at DCTRL and we’re working on a new smart contract to take control of the abandoned contract (we tried to buy it out but that didn’t work). We’ll be ready to deploy the test contract soon. If you’re a code or law hacker and can help, get in touch!

## Epilogue
It is now ever so slightly further into the future.Your team has worked together to gain much Doge, and you have taken an important step towards making the world a better place|getting rich|creating something new and exciting|addressing the injustices of the existing system|paying your debts on-chain [DELETE AS APPROPRIATE - WE COULDN’T AUTOMATE THIS PART SORRY, MAYBE THAT’S AN ICO OPPORTUNITY RIGHT THERE].

Some of the world has been watching you, some of the world has been caught up in its own challenges. Some people have been inspired by your efforts, some have actively opposed them, others have tried to ride on them for good or for ill. You’ve solved fearsome challenges, completed mind bending tasks, scanned more QR codes than you thought possible in a single day, stayed hydrated and looked both ways while crossing the road.

Did you become Dogeillionares? If so, amaze, you can now anchor your project to the one true chain and change the world. Just like your foreshibes used to. You must promise to use this power only for good. No exit scams.

Or did you not become Dogeillionaires? If so then looking at everything you achieved anyway then that’s amaze too. You can still change the world with that kind of attitude. Just like your other  foreshibes used to. Maybe you don’t have to be part of the one true chain to do so.

But then is this really the one true chain? You’ve encountered so many different ways of doing things. Does the chain make the shibe or does the shibe make the chain?

Perhaps the true shibe was in our hearts all along and in the friends we made along the way.

Or, if that’s not a gritty cyberpunk-enough ending, perhaps the true shibe being in our hearts all along and guiding us and the people we meet along the way is the only way to be antifragile enough to survive in the gritty cyberpunk dark future - or to make that future lighter.

And to make everything more wow.
