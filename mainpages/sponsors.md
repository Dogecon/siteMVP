# Big Thanks To Our Sponsors

The spirit of Dogecoin has always been about sharing the wealth, and we’ve seen the cryptocurrency sector swell over the past year into a formidable global market that is impossible for even legacy finance institutions to ignore. Within this time of "Great Wealth Transfer," we believe that companies and organizations can help equalize access for all individuals, and we've teamed up with amazing sponsors who share that vision. We give much thanks to our supporting partners, who have helped ensure that crypto culture is shaped by communities, for communities. Their generosity will help us keep public ticket costs low, and make it easier to get all our honoured guests to Vancouver for this magical weekend experience.

        <p>We are honoured to be working with Presearch to shape the whimsical beauty of Dogecon, and we thank them for their title sponsorship, which enables the State of the Doge Address, DogeQuest: Hunt for the One True Chain, and other integral aspects of this weekend. We've known Colin and Shannon since last year, and been consistently inspired by their commitment to the core values driving the decentralization community.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.presearch.io/">Presearch</a> is an open, decentralized search engine that rewards community members with Presearch Tokens for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform. In a world where one company controls 77% of all searches, influencing trillions of dollars in spending, shaping perceptions and effectively acting as the primary gatekeeper to the Internet, a new, open and community-driven search engine is a necessity.</p>

        <p>Presearch has an innovative go-to-market strategy to target the most frequent searchers - web workers - and gain early adoption, on our way to releasing future versions of the open source platform that will utilize a blockchain-based index, curated by the community.</p>
