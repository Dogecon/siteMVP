## How to Buy Dogecon tickets (crypto only for now):

• A **regular pass** will grant you access to all public events from Thursday evening June 21, through Sunday night June 24. Its cost in crypto is pegged to $200 CAD.

• A **MAD upgrade pass** (Much Amazing Doge) gets you drink tickets at our nighttime networking events, a boxed lunch of your choice at the DOGETalks picnic on Friday June 22nd, and an artfully assembled Doge swag bag with <a href="http://www.theddp.com" target="_black">classic DDP flair</a>. Its cost in crypto is pegged to $420 CAD.
