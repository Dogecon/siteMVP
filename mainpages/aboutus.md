### [Carpe Lunam Events Assocation](#lunam)
### [Dogecon Organizing Team](#team)

<h2 id='lunam'> Carpe Lunam Events Assocation </h2>

Carpe Lunam Events Association was formed as a nonprofit member-funded society in British Columbia to serve as the seat of Dogecon’s operations when it was wisely suggested to us that we might not want to just wing it anarchically on this large of a scale. This society’s constitution ([PDF warning](/images/carpelunamconstitution.pdf)) outlines our shared purposes for this and future projects:
* to organize community events which promote collaborative community dialogue around intentional and ethical design in the disruptive technology field;
* to provide an accessible platform for grassroots artists, musicians, writers, programmers, and other creators to enhance their visibility within the larger decentralization community; and
* to support widespread education about decentralization, blockchain technology, voluntaryism, and non-hierarchical governance

Check out our "Get Involved" page for more information on collaborating with us!

<h2 id='team'> Dogecon Organizing Team </h2>

The following is a short list of the core team involved in this pursuit: we welcome outreach around collaborating with us!
* **Gary Lachance** has held the beginning threads of Dogecon in his heart for quite some time, and he guides our spirits in this pursuit as in so many others; he’ll be masterminding the DDP and State of the Doge Address.
* **Chelsea Palmer** has been furiously whiteboarding and Trello-listing this instantiation of Dogecon for months now, and she’ll be designing DOGETalks and the Midsummer Night’s Meme Rap Affair.
* **Sophia Hughes** ensured this vivid meme dream became a concrete reality with her operations finesse, overseeing the structural implementation of a truly organized unconvention with the classiest of style.
* **Alex Salkeld** has steered the event’s unfolding as a true Doge Preacher, and is architecting the ultimate gamified experience for DogeQuest: Hunt For the One True Chain, as well as serving as dual MC for DOGETalks.
* **Ludmila Maresova** brings a critical eye for detail and valuable strategic foresight to the operational team, ensuring all our plans are in order and our documentation is impeccable.
* **Arman Mottaghi** is steering SCRUM-style sprints and auditing team collaborative practices to batten down the hatches for a richly complex execution phase once all systems are go.
* **Tanna Po** is our in-house crypto artist and mystical muse, executing everything from paintings to icon design to ensure that the many faces of the Doge make themselves seen.
* **Cameron Gray** has led us to excellence from the beginning with his graphic design and tongue-in-cheek sayings, ensuring that we stay true to the decentralist whimsy of the Doge.
* **Rob Myers** has advised the Carpe Lunam crew on matters from artistic to practical since this project’s inception, and will serve as the storymaster for the DogeQuest game and beyond.
* **Jacob Robert Steeves** is lending his wildly sharp mind to crafting riddles and puzzles to add layers of abstraction to the DogeQuest competition.
* **Jared Harrill** and **Krishna Sriram**, dual masterminds bringing Vancouver’s dctrl ethos to the global blockchain scene, have advised and supported us in seeking out sponsor relationships.
* Many more amazing humans are in various talks about participation
