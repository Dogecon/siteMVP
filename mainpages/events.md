On the evening of **Thursday, June 21st**, join the Vancouver blockchain community for a welcome ceremony at beautiful Beaumont Studios, where we’ll have signature Doge-inspired cocktails, peruse meme-themed art, and listen to short talks about how open communication can transcend tech sector tribalism, reinforcing that *DOGE = LOVE* and *MOON = ALWAYS*.

Participants are welcome to join our core team in boldly declaring their commitment to spend the long weekend ahead with open minds, open ears, and open hearts. Themes: radical forgiveness, embracing neurodiversity, second chances.

On **Friday, June 22nd**, we’ve got the day booked out in SFU’s spacious Harbour Centre venue, with panels in the Fletcher Challenge Canada Theatre and breakout groups and workshops in the Segal Centre. We’ll keep the menu for the day fresh and healthy, in terms of both catering and content.

We will explore the theoretical underpinnings of aspirational economic design, working together to define our terms when it comes to the philosophy and economics of trustless systems. We will boldly steer towards complex, flexible, and collaborative group definitions for concepts like value, antifragility, consensus, and abundance.

Rather than a hackathon, Dogecon will be anchored around a D&D-inspired crypto scavenger hunt all across downtown Vancouver on **Saturday, June 23rd**. Teams of four or more people will follow clues and communications to solve puzzles around the city and try to be the first to complete the game and “save the Doge”. When each location is reached and the multi-layered puzzle is solved, teams will unlock the next part of the DogeQuest story.

Over 20 local landmarks, and historic crypto locations (like the home of the world’s first Bitcoin ATM) have been mapped to plot out this innovative game. Teams will test their crypto knowledge and skills while competing for **ONE MILLION DOGE**!!!!

Meanwhile, organizers, sponsors, and other cornerstones of the Doge community will meet for the invitational State of the Doge Address at the stunning Wosk Centre for Dialogue. We’ll be livestreaming to the world, and preparing for some wild surprises!

<h2 id='ddp'> Decentralized Doge Party 2.0  </h2>

After the cessation of DogeQuest, we’ll gather on the **evening of Saturday June 23rd** for the Second Ever Decentralized Doge Party. This will be an open source mobile party that uses an FM transmitter to beam music and the love of the doge to hundreds of vintage boomboxes, creating a traveling synchronized sound system. We’ll be bringing out the giant rocket and endless other crazy props as we paint the town Doge all night.

With the power of WOW, we’re taking the Decentralized Dance Party to levels previously thought impossible. You’ll experience a night on the town like never before as you traverse the city streets and the party follows -- or do you follow the party? Never fear getting lost, the Doge signs will be held high for everyone to see, and our music travels for miles. Just follow the Doge and everything will be wow.

<h2 id='rap'> Midsummer Night’s Meme Rap Affair  </h2>

After **Sunday June 24th**’s daylong drop-in culture crawl focused on rest and wellbeing, the closing ceremony of Dogecon will be an experiment in decadence after a thoroughly exhausting, hands-on weekend. Taking place from late afternoon till late night, we’ll combine a laid-back boudoir atmosphere with catering bites inspired by the pursuit of balance between utter decadent indulgence and healthy freshness.

MCs both local and global will regale us with nerdy verses as we take in the sights of the final art displays from the long weekend. We’ll have a special surprise to end the night, ensuring we all remember Dogecon 2018 forever.
