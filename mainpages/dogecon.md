## Carpe Lunam Events Association is pleased to pull back the curtain to reveal our plans for Dogecon 2018, an absurdist celebration of cryptoeconomics and meme culture in Vancouver, BC.

### Dogecon will be a playful and participatory decentralist community celebration during Summer Solstice, with core events occurring from the evening of Thursday June 21 to the late hours of Sunday June 24. A breakdown of these can be found on pages 5-7 of this brochure.

#### Swaths of time in between will exist as a well-documented but relatively permissionless culture crawl showcase of the thriving tech, arts, and culture scene of Vancouver, with lots of chances to enjoy the summer scenery. Overall, the four day weekend will build upon the “unconference” event format to craft a participatory “unconvention,” with special attention paid to elements of gamification, performativity, and whimsical creativity.

<h2 id='invite'> Who's Invited </h2>

*We are Shibes that dare, still, to dream.*

We #BUIDL upon the foundation of the long-standing Vancouver node of the global decentralist community, and we embrace the absurdist beauty and wisdom of Dogecoin, the Doge meme, and all its trappings. We see play as a collaborative method for learning together, and the Doge meme as an appropriate foundation for a crypto cease-fire.

You can see a more detailed breakdown of our core team and advisors on the "About Us" page; suffice to say we’re a bunch of relatively old-school crypto fans who want to craft an incomparably creative and unforgettable weekend experience. We’ve been engaged in strategic outreach and invitation since February, securing participation and sponsorship from  key figures in the developer, artist, and social media spaces of cryptocurrency.

## We Want You at Dogecon If:
* You understand that this is simultaneously super-serious professional-type business, and a super-fun epic joke made real
* You are interested in cryptocurrency no matter what the current prices are
* You are passionate about art, music, gaming, BUIDLing, and open source
* You are comfortable with a more Burning Man style experience than a formal conference: this is a participatory art piece, and a four-day-long autonomous zone!

<h2 id='expect'> What to Expect </h2>

Dogecon is about collaborative and lighthearted cultural immersion, playing on Summer Solstice traditions interwoven with memetic themes. We encourage you to come along prepared to really get involved: soon enough you might find yourself on stage with a mic in your hand, or up to your elbows in paint, or deep in relaxing meditation. There will be diverse options for participation.

Saturday’s day and night activities will mostly be completely free for the general public to spectate and/or participate, though there will be a set fee for teams entering DogeQuest to compete for the prize, and there is a State of the Doge Address on Saturday evening which will be invite-only due to the venue’s size. All ticketed events will be filmed or streamed for free access online.

Find out more about our plans for ticket sales and prices on our "Get Involved" page!

We’ll have a Vancouver Ecosystem maps overlay on our site during the long weekend, showing local businesses, sponsors, art spaces and “unconvention” nodes. We’re aiming to score discounts and specials for our attendees at downtown restaurants, and to coordinate with the thriving local event scene to list all the meetups, talks, and other cool activities that are underway.

Financial inclusivity is crucial to us, and we’ll have limited opportunities to volunteer in exchange for a free weekend pass based on need - [email us](mailto:carpelunam@gmail.com) with “Volunteer Inquiry” in the email header, and we’ll send you more info soon!


<h2 id='events'> Main Events </h2>

<h3> Healing Moon Launch Ceremony </h3>

On the evening of Thursday, June 21st, join the Vancouver blockchain community for a welcome ceremony at beautiful Beaumont Studios, where we’ll have signature Doge-inspired cocktails, peruse meme-themed art, and listen to short talks about how open communication can transcend tech sector tribalism, reinforcing that *DOGE = LOVE* and *MOON = ALWAYS*.

Participants are welcome to join our core team in boldly declaring their commitment to spend the long weekend ahead with open minds, open ears, and open hearts. Themes: radical forgiveness, embracing neurodiversity, second chances.

<h3> DOGETalks Cryptoeconomics Summit </h3>

On Friday, June 22nd, we’ve got the day booked out in SFU’s spacious Harbour Centre venue, with panels in the Fletcher Challenge Canada Theatre and breakout groups and workshops in the Segal Centre. We’ll keep the menu for the day fresh and healthy, in terms of both catering and content.

We will explore the theoretical underpinnings of aspirational economic design, working together to define our terms when it comes to the philosophy and economics of trustless systems. We will boldly steer towards complex, flexible, and collaborative group definitions for concepts like value, antifragility, consensus, and abundance.


<h3> DogeQuest: Hunt For The One True Chain </h3>

Rather than a hackathon, Dogecon will be anchored around a D&D-inspired crypto scavenger hunt all across downtown Vancouver on Saturday, June 23rd. Teams of five or more people will follow clues and communications to solve puzzles around the city and try to be the first to complete the game and “save the Doge”. When each location is reached and the multi-layered puzzle is solved, teams will unlock the next part of the DogeQuest story.

Over 20 local landmarks, and historic crypto locations (like the home of the world’s first Bitcoin ATM) have been mapped to plot out this innovative game. Teams will test their crypto knowledge and skills while competing for ONE MILLION DOGE!!!!

Meanwhile, organizers, sponsors, and other cornerstones of the Doge community will meet for the invitational State of the Doge Address at the stunning Wosk Centre for Dialogue. We’ll be livestreaming to the world, and preparing for some wild surprises!

<h3> Decentralized Doge Party 2.0 </h3>

After the cessation of DogeQuest, we’ll gather on the evening of Saturday June 23rd for the Second Ever Decentralized Doge Party. This will be an open source mobile party that uses an FM transmitter to beam music and the love of the doge to hundreds of vintage boomboxes, creating a traveling synchronized sound system. We’ll be bringing out the giant rocket and endless other crazy props as we paint the town Doge all night.

With the power of WOW, we’re taking the Decentralized Dance Party to levels previously thought impossible. You’ll experience a night on the town like never before as you traverse the city streets and the party follows -- or do you follow the party? Never fear getting lost, the Doge signs will be held high for everyone to see, and our music travels for miles. Just follow the Doge and everything will be wow.


<h3> Midsummer Night’s Meme Rap Affair </h3>

After Sunday June 24th’s daylong drop-in culture crawl focused on rest and wellbeing, the closing ceremony of Dogecon will be an experiment in decadence after a thoroughly exhausting, hands-on weekend. Taking place from late afternoon till late night, we’ll combine a laid-back boudoir atmosphere with catering bites inspired by the pursuit of balance between utter decadent indulgence and healthy freshness.

MCs both local and global will regale us with nerdy verses as we take in the sights of the final art displays from the long weekend. We’ll have a special surprise to end the night, ensuring we all remember Dogecon 2018 forever.
